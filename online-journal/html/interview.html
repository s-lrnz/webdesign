		<h3>“This is me. Here I am. Accept me for what I am, voilà.”<br>
		That’s the simple but powerful message found in Barbara Pravi‘s<br>
		Eurovision 2021 song.
		</h3>
		
		<br>
		<p>The “Voilà” lyrics are simple and direct, portraying a woman who has been hiding<br>
		in the shadows, marinating in the insecurities and shame that come with living on mute.<br>
		In her text we hear a woman ready to take ownership of herself and her dream <br>
		to write music and to sing.

			<h2>“Writing for yourself instead writing for<br> someone else, do you find it more difficult, <br>more painful?”</h2>
		<br>
			<p>Of course. Because I already write for myself and there’s already<br> 
			two EP’s on the market, so I already write for myself. But in the<br>
			vision of making for Eurovision it is different because you already<br>
			know that your song is going to be seen and heard by a lot<br>
			of people.
		<br>
		<br>
			I think you have to be more truthful with yourself and more straight<br>
			with you in words, every notes, and every part of the song because<br> 
			a lot of people see you.</p>

			<h2>"Barbara Pravi — What do the 'Voilà' lyrics mean?"</h2>
		<br>
			<p>I often think that ‘Voilà’ is the end and the beginning of something.
				<br>
				<br>
				It’s the end of twenty five years of a battle with myself to feel happy,<br>
				to feel proud, to understand that I am capable of doing things.<br>
				It’s the beginning because now I am ready to say hello, that’s me,<br>
				and I don’t mind if you like me…because that’s just what I am.<br>
				That’s everything I am… This is all I have, this is all I got, here I am,<br>
				and voilà.
				<br>
				<br>
				My crazy dream is to spread messages and say things. I want my<br> 
				things to be heard by people. This is the only thing I have —<br>
				I only have my voice, my soul, all my body and everything to sing.<br>
				This is the message of ‘Voilà’. It says please hear me because<br>
				I only have this.<br> <br>
				If you aren’t here to hear me, then I am nothing.

			<h2>"It’s like coming out as a singer — something<br>
				Barbara	says she was fully able to do during the<br>
				Eurovision submission process last September."</h2>
		<br>
			<p>Until September my music was confidential. I live in Paris,<br>
				so I know that people in Paris know me.	It’s only a small town.<br>
				I want to make music for the world.	I want all the world to hear<br>
				my songs and it will be a dream.<br>
				<br>
				The difference is I don’t want my music to be confidential anymore.<br>
				If it can be more gigantic I will be very proud and very happy.
